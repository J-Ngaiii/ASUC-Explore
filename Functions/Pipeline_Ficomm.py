def cont_approval_helper(input, start=['Contingency Funding'], end=['Finance Rule', 'Space Reservation', 'Sponsorship']):
   """
   Extracts and organizes data from a given agenda string, sorting it into a dictionary where:
   - Keys are the meeting dates.
   - Values are sub-dictionaries with club names as keys and Ficomm decisions (such as approval amounts or tabled status) as values.

   The function searches for the specified start and end keywords to define the boundaries of the "Contingency Funding" section within the input agenda. It processes each section for clubs and their respective motions, and returns a structured dictionary containing the results.

   Version 3.2: Changes with ficomm meeting date being pd.Timestamp object and denied applications having "0" for amount allocated.
   - Handling multiple conflicting motions (which shouldn't even happen) currently is done by prioritizing record rejections > temporary tabling > approvals > no input. Maybe we change this later down the line.

   Args:
      input (str): The raw text of the agenda to be processed.
      start (list, optional): A list of keywords that mark the beginning of the section to extract (default is `['Contingency Funding']`).
      end (list, optional): A list of keywords that mark the end of the section to extract (default is `['Finance Rule', 'Space Reservation', 'Sponsorship']`).

   Returns:
      dict: A dictionary where each date (str) is a key, and the value is another dictionary mapping club names (str) to Ficomm decisions (str).

   Raises:
      Exception: If the input text is empty.
      Exception: If the start or end lists are empty or not valid lists.

   Notes:
      - The function uses regular expressions to extract meeting dates, clubs, and motions.
      - Efficiency may not be optimal for large agendas due to the regex-based search.
      - This function is designed for agendas in a specific format and may not work for other types of input.

   def cont_appender_helper(pattern, start_list, end_list):
      """
      Constructs a regular expression pattern to extract text between specified start and end keywords.

      This helper function is designed to generate a regex pattern that can be used to extract content from a text document between the first occurrence of any keyword in the `start_list` and the first occurrence of any keyword in the `end_list`.

      It is primarily used for processing Ficomm agendas, where sections are delineated by specific keywords such as 'Contingency Funding' and 'Finance Rule'. The generated regex pattern is designed for use in functions like `re.findall()` to extract sections of text between these markers.

      Args:
         pattern (str): The base regular expression pattern to which the start and end keywords will be appended. This serves as the starting point for building the full regex.
         start_list (list): A list of keywords that mark the beginning of the section to capture. The function will match the first occurrence of any of these keywords.
         end_list (list): A list of keywords that mark the end of the section to capture. The function will stop capturing when any of these keywords is found.

      Returns:
         str: A complete regular expression pattern that matches content between the start and end keywords. The pattern can be used in a function like `re.findall()` to extract the desired sections from the input text.

      Raises:
         Exception: If either `start_list` or `end_list` is empty or not a list.

      Notes:
         - This function uses non-greedy matching and lookahead assertions to ensure that the text between the start and end markers is captured accurately.
         - The returned pattern can be used to capture multiple sections if they occur in the input text. It is specifically designed for processing Ficomm agenda formats but could be adapted for other purposes.
      
      Example:
         >>> cont_appender_helper(pattern, ['Contingency Funding', 'Space Reservation'], ['Sponsorship', 'Rule Waiver'])
         Appender will return a regex pattern that when fed into an extraction function like re.findall returns all text that comes
         after the first appearance of 'Contingency Funding' or 'Space Reservation' and before the first appearance of 'Sponsorship' or 'Rule Waiver'

    Matches rows in df1 to df2 based on fuzzy matching and optional NLP embedding similarity.

    Parameters:

    - matching_col (str): Column for matching on in both dataframes (e.g., "Organization Name").

    - Maybe also make sure filter is applied to df2[matching_col] cuz if we apply the filter to the names we're tryna match they should also be applied to the name list we're matching against

    - Made nlp processing toggleable for more precise testing (ver 2.2)
    - Added `nlp_process_threshold` to minimize unnecessary NLP comparisons. (ver 2.1)
